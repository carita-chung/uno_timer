<h3>Description</h3><br>
<p>The Arduino UNO is a microcontroller development board based on a 8 bit AVR mircocontroller. The development platform used is the Arduino IDE and there are a large number of open source libraries available, this makes it idea to experiment with common electronic components and to create simple electronic projects quickly.</p>
<br>
<h3>Functions, Features and Usage</h3><br>
<P>The timer can perform count-downs from 1 to 99 minutes in 1 minute intervals. Upon powering up, "01 --" is shown. This indicates the initial setting of counting down from 1 minute. Pressing the single button will advance the count minutes by one minute and the LED display will be updated.</p>

<br>
<p>To activate the count-down, a long press (press and hold) on the button is required. The LED display will change and begin to display the count-down in minutes and seconds. When the count-down reaches zero, the buzzer will sound and the display changes to alternating dashes.</p>

<h3>Parts / Bill of Material</h3><br>
<br><img src="uno_timer_p3.jpg"><br><br>
<br><br>
<ul>
<li>An Arduino UNO microcontroller development board</li>
<li>A 3461BS 7 segment 4 digit LED module</li>
<li>1 tactile button, 6 x 6 2 pin type</li>
<li>1 mini breadboard, 170 points</li>
<li>1 5V buzzer, 170 points</li>
<li>About 1 foot of breadboard wire (swg 22)</li>
</ul>
</>

<p>The only tool that you may need is a pair of wire cutter / strippers</p>
<h3>Schematic, Source Code and Build Hints</h3><br>
<br><img src="uno_timer_schem.png"><br><br>
<p>Timing are done via the millis() function of the Arduino core library. Count-down timer vairable decreases every second. When the timer variable reaches zero, buzzer is activated and will only be silenced upon a keypress on the tactile button.</p>
<br>
<p>The 4 digits 7 segment LED module provides display capability. It is a passive device. A multiplexing library is used to show the count-down values. 12 IO pins are used for multiplexing, 4 of which controls the digits and the rest take care of the 7 segments + decimal point.</p>
<br>
<p>A single tactile button is also wired to accept user input.</p>
